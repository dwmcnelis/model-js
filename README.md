## What is Model.js?

Model.js is a simple model layer for web applications. It supports a dynamic model definition scheme based on JSON properties.

It is used internally here at Tidemann&Co for all our web applications that require a model layer in JavaScript.

## Installation

Installation is done via npm:

```
$ npm install tdmnco-model-js
```

## Documentation

Using Model.js is simple and easy. Consider the following example:

```javascript
import { Model } from 'tdmnco-model-js'

class Post extends Model {}

let post = new Post({
  content: 'I love cherries!',
  id: '1',
  title: 'A tribute to cherries'
})

post.author = 'Kasper Tidemann'

post.save()
```

### Update hooks

Model.js supports hooks for when the value of a property is updated:

```javascript
import { Model } from 'tdmnco-model-js'

class Fruit extends Model {}

let apple = new Fruit({
  color: 'green',
  id: '2'
})

apple.onUpdate((property, before, after) => {
  console.log('The apple ' + property + ' was ' + before + ', but now it is ' + after + '!')
})

apple.color = 'red'
```

The above example will print `The apple color was green, but now it is red!` in the console.

### Prevent uglifying model names

If you use Parcel, Webpack or a similar bundler, your model names will be uglified when minimized for production.

This results in data stored in `localStorage` with names like `i-1` and `y-2` instead of `Post-1` and `User-2`.

In order to prevent this, prototype the name of a given model:

```javascript
import { Model } from 'tdmnco-model-js'

class Post extends Model {}

Post.prototype.modelName = 'Post'

export { Post }
```

### Build

Model.js makes use of [Parcel]() for building the distributable `index.js`. In order to build the project, issue the following command in your terminal:

```
$ npm run dist
```

### Test

Model.js makes use of [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for its test suite. In order to run the test suite, issue the following command in your terminal:

```
$ npm run test
```
